# URL-Shortener
A URL Shortener is an online tool or service that converts long, complex web addresses into shorter, user-friendly links without losing the ability to direct users to the original page. This greatly simplifies sharing content—especially on platforms with character limits and in digital marketing or social media where clarity and briefness matter.
